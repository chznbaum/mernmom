bio: When you're a mom in a male-dominated industry, it can sometimes be hard to have someone in your corner or who understands your challenges. I had my kids before learning to code, and I started my tech career while they were still pre-school age. I've literally led code meetups with my toddler around my ankles. While our experience may not be identical, I've got your back on this JavaScript journey.
